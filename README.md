# 4.-Lead-Scoring---Linear-Regression-Case-Study
We build the Multiple linear regression model for this case study by using Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.
X education company sell the online courses through their websites. Company gets leads if people visit their website & fill the form by using mail id & mobile no. Company also get lead from their past referrals. Once lead gets Sales team start getting in touch with peoples, through the process some of leads converted or some of not, Lead conversion rate is only 30%.   
Company wants to increase conversion rates. Company wants to build the model in such way that each customer should assign lead score by using model. If higher the lead, then higher conversion chances vice versa. 
Approach â€“ Import data set, Data cleaning-preparations, EDA, splitting data Test Train, Building Regression model & calculate lead score. 
Evaluating the model by using specificity, sensitivity, Precision, Recall.
Applying the model in test data set.
